The project showcases a product catalog. Users can filter, search, and add products to their cart. The homepage features sliders that allow users to scroll through products. Additionally, while browsing products, users can use pagination to narrow down the list of results. Users also have the option to add products to their favorites. The project utilizes React and React Router libraries and fetches data from a server. By using useParams and LocalStorage, it enables the generation of links with saved data regarding filtering, pagination, and products added to favorites and the cart. The website is also responsive for mobile phones and tablets.
